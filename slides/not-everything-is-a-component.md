##  Not everything is a component

note:
  thought top to bottom (website style)
  before we realize we have hundred of components (some useless) (even created an html parser! doesnt make sense) 
  and we REFACTOR
  translate features in components and not everything to a component
  extract common methods on behaviours to reuse code
  we recheck the catalog
  because probably there is a component for that
  REFACTOR / CLEANUP / REFACTOR
  and we end up with half of the amount that we started with
  Lesson: think as component, be a component
  -example of content-view-
