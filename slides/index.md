# Polymer: The ugly truth

# why-web-components
  new web solution to our product
  discussion about React/Web Components
  Web components is sexy
  so we start

# check-the-catalog
  start to play with elements
  portability and reusability
  abstract complexity out of the app
  flexibility
  we start with polymer 1.0

# issues-with-polymer-1-0
  structure of elements
  documentation was crap
  versioning, elements didn't work well with others             --- nodejs at the beginning
  not production ready                                          --- screenshot of polymer 1.0docs
  so we start ...

# creating-our-first-components
  learning curve
  consistency on patterns / code standards
  multiple team members with different skill set                --- photo
  whole new set tools
  integrate our components sucks!!!

# not-everything-is-a-component
  thought top to bottom (website style)
  before we realize we have hundred of components (some useless) (even created an html parser! doesnt make sense) 
  and we REFACTOR
  translate features in components and not everything to a component
  extract common methods on behaviours to reuse code
  we recheck the catalog
  because probably there is a component for that
  REFACTOR / CLEANUP / REFACTOR
  and we end up with half of the amount that we started with
  Lesson: think as component, be a component
  -example of content-view-

# properties-down-events-up       -- data
- be-lazy
- events
- async
- waiting for other components

# multi-plaform-automated-design    -- design


# a-year-after-working-with-polymer
  web components are still sexy
  we improve our building process 
  we did our first two polymer only implementations in our first 3 months
  and now we can deliver an implementation within 1 sprint (two weeks)
  but we still can improve

# next step
- sw
- cache, notification, pwa
- updating 2.0
- animations


# extra, dynamic metadata
