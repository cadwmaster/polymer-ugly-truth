##  A year after working with Polymer...
  WebComponents are still sexy!  
  First 2 implementations within 3 months  
  Deliver in one sprint

note:
  web components are still sexy
  we improve our building process 
  we did our first two polymer only implementations in our first 3 months
  and now we can deliver an implementation within 1 sprint (two weeks)
  but we still can improve
